## Ensuring Clean Game Install

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

```
If you've ever modded Cyberpunk before, it's important to ensure you have a clean game folder
```

Go to your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory and delete the **all** folders except for **"archive"**

![Clean Install 1](https://i.imgur.com/AXG7U40.png)

Additionally delete the **"mod"** folder in **"Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/"**

![Clean Install 2](https://i.imgur.com/YW0s73X.png)

Now make sure you go and verify your game files through **Steam**, **GOG** or **Epic**

## For REDmod Users Only

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

```
Ignore this step if you have not installed the REDmod DLC, as it will screw up your install. This is a mandatory step for users who have installed the REDmod DLC
```

If you have installed the **REDmod DLC**, go to the [cybercmd page at the link below](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5176?tab=files)

[![cybercmd](https://i.imgur.com/QKHJlGJ.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5176?tab=files "cybercmd download")

## Updating Collection

Updating the collection is as easy as clicking the **"Update"** button

![Update](https://i.imgur.com/8UDf7uP.png)

When prompted to **"Remove mods from old revision"** make sure to click the **"Remove All"** button

![Update Removing Old Mods](https://i.imgur.com/8RzrQPh.png)

The uninstalled mod archives are left in the **"Mods"** list in bright blue, which you should delete

![Update Removing Old Mods step 2](https://i.imgur.com/OdfLQcO.png)

```
Do not update any of the mods in the collection individually in Vortex! The philosophy of this collection is that when a mod updates, we update a full revision in order to keep everything up to date and interfacing correctly; when you see a new revision, update to it. If anything special is needed we will mention it in the changelog
```

## CET Setup

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

When you start the game for the first time you will be met with an overlay prompting you to choose a key to toggle on Cyber Engine Tweaks, recommend that you choose the **"~"** key for the **"Overlay Key"**

![First CET Popup](https://i.imgur.com/lgIR1mi.png)

The main **"Cyber Engine Tweaks"** window will now pop up, and on it you should click the **"Bindings"** button near the top left of the window

![CET Binding](https://i.imgur.com/HiLTXZA.png)

Recommend binding keys for **"BetterScopes",** **"CustomQuickslots",** **"NanoDrone",** and **"QuestTrackingToggle"** in the **"Bindings"** section that pops up

Below the section there is a **"Save"** button which you should click to save any changes

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

## Quickslots Settings

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

In Cyberpunk, there is no way to bind multiple hotkeys for actions, items, or abilities, as each must be assigned through the menu to the one assignable hotkey at a time, leading to gameplay interruptions if you want to play well. [Custom Quickslots](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3096) solves this issue by allowing bindable hotkeys which show up on the Native game UI and allow you up to 20 hotkeyed actions, abilities, or items. Some small setup is required

```
Navigating the Mods menu uses the arrows at the top to switch between the different pages of mods
```

After clicking **"Mods"** in the main menu, navigate to the **"QSLOTS"** section, recommend changing **"Other Consumable Item Mods Compatibility Mode,"** **"Hide empty consumable and grenade slots,"** **"Hide empty cyberware ability slots"** and **"Small item slots"** to **"On"**. Recommend changing **"Number of Custom Quickslots"** to **"0"** and then adding slots as needed during the course of gameplay.
